### I'm currently working on:
- [Atlas Protocol](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/Atlas-Protocol) - Intent-driven digital design.
- [OnSite Presence Monitor](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/OnSite-Presence-Monitor) - An evacuation dashboard, a Dash app for showing who is currently clocked in at work in case of emergancy and evacuation.
- [Atlas-MCP](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/Atlas-MCP) - An attempt on local run AI agents doing Industry 4.0 things, heavy inspired by Walker Reynolds. It's a learning experience.
- 🟢🟠🔴 KIEL - A kanban style Dash app that sorts orders based upon feasability and available materials.
- 📔 SkillForge - A workforce skill management and equipment database, for documented training and maintenance logging.

### So what's happening?
So the whole Atlas idea was born and concepted in about a week, I've shared *some* of the [blueprints](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/Atlas-Protocol/tree/main/docs/blueprints), but there are **many** more.
I will upload them when the *time is right*, most likely after I get a MVP of Atlas Protocol out. I just need to learn some stuff
so I can build the tools I need to make it into what it will become.

And at the same time I'm also working full time on the factory floor, and I'm kinda trying to build a portfolio nad at the same
time help with projects that could be useful at work. :shipit:
