## Hi I'm Tom 👋

### About me:
- 🏭Born in '81, Norwegian, factory worker since 1999, currently 20 years (and counting!) making distribution transformers ⚡.
- 👨‍💻 Started learning Python december 2023, still learning every day.
- 🔗 Interested in **Industry 4.0/5.0**, **IoT** and **Digital Twins**.
- 💻 Looking into C++ and later Mojo.

### I'm currently working on:
- [Atlas Protocol](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/Atlas-Protocol) - Intent-driven digital design.
- [OnSite Presence Monitor](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/OnSite-Presence-Monitor) - An evacuation dashboard, a Dash app for showing who is currently clocked in at work in case of emergency and evacuation.
- [Atlas-MCP](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/Atlas-MCP) - An attempt on local run AI agents doing Industry 4.0 things, heavy inspired by Walker Reynolds. It's a learning experience, and not worked on as I still got some huge books to go through before some actual progress happens.
- [ProtoX Game Developer Kit (GDK)](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/Protox_GDK) - A modular retro-style game creation kit built in Python, featuring integrated editors for sprites, levels, and scenes - all sharing a unified, human-readable JSON format.
- 🟢🟠🔴 KIEL - A kanban style Dash app that sorts orders based upon feasibility and available materials.
- 📔 SkillForge - A workforce skill management and equipment database, for documented training and maintenance logging.
- ⚙️ Atlas-OCC Wrapper - A lightweight OCC wrapper built for Atlas Protocol.
- ⚙️ GDK-Runtime - A pip-installable import to handle the GDK files for PyGame and maybe others.
- 🚧 ...and more.

### So what's happening?
So the whole Atlas idea was born and concerted in about a week, I've shared *some* of the [blueprints](https://github.com/ProtoXCode/Atlas-Protocol/tree/main/docs/blueprints), but there are **many** more.
I will upload them when the *time is right*, most likely after I get a MVP of Atlas Protocol out. I just need to learn some stuff,
so I can build the tools I need to make it into what it will become.

And at the same time I'm also working full-time on the factory floor, and I'm kinda trying to build a portfolio nad at the same
time help with projects that could be useful at work. :shipit:
